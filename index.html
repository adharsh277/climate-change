                <h1><b>What is Climate Change ?</b></h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Climate Change</b> refers to the long-term and significant changes in the Earth's average weather patterns and temperatures over a period of decades or longer. These changes are mainly caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, which trap heat and cause global temperatures to rise. <br><br>
                    The effects of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes, as well as changes in ecosystems and wildlife. These changes are a major concern as they pose significant risks to human health, infrastructure, and the economy, and can also lead to social and political instability.

                <p>
                    Addressing climate change requires global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of measures, including transitioning to clean energy sources, improving energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and developing carbon capture and storage technologies.

                <h1>Humans are responsible for global warming:</h1>
                <p>
                    Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.<br><br>
                    The average temperature of the Earth’s surface is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2022) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.<br><br>
                    Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.<br><br>
                    The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.

                    <h1>People are experiencing climate change <br>in diverse ways:</h1>
                    <p>Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is expected to rise.</p>

                 <div class="methods">
                    <h1>Every increase in global warming matters:</h1>
                    <p>In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.

                        <br><br>The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.
                        
                        <br><br>Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.</p>

                            <h1>We face a huge challenge but<br> already know many solutions:</h1>
                            <p>Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments.

                                <br><br>Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: over two-thirds of today’s proven reserves of fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.

                    <p>Climate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.</p>
